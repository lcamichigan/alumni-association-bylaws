Party Actions_. The Corporation has the power to indemnify a person who was or
is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to a threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil criminal, administrative or
investigative and whether formal or informal (other than an action by or in the
right of this Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a
Director, officer, employee, volunteer or agent of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, partner,
trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, business
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, whether for
profit or not for profit, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees),
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by that person in connection with the action, suit or
proceeding if that person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably
believed by that person to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation or its members, and with respect to a criminal action or proceeding,
if that person had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.
The termination of an action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a
manner reasonably believed by that person to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation or its members and, with respect to a criminal
action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct
was unlawful.

2. <a name="indemnification-actions-in-the-right-of-the-corporation"></a>
_Indemnification: Actions in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation has
the power to indemnify a person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be
made a party to a threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the
right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that the person is or was a Director, officer, employee, volunteer or agent
of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of this Corporation as a
Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or
domestic corporation, business corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, whether for profit or not against expenses (including actual
and reasonable attorneys’ fees) and amounts paid in settlement incurred by that
person in connection with the action or suit if that person acted in good faith
and in a manner reasonably believed by that person to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation or its members. However, no
indemnification shall be made for a claim, issue or matter in which such person
shall have been found to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the
extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought has determined
upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all
circumstances of the case, that person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnification for the expenses which the court considers proper.

3. _Indemnification: Mandatory and Permissive Payments_.

    1. To the extent that Director, officer, employee, volunteer or agent of the
    Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of an
    action, suit or proceeding referred to in
    [Section 1](#indemnification-third-party-actions) or
    [Section 2](#indemnification-actions-in-the-right-of-the-corporation) of
    this Article, or in defense of a claim, issue or matter in the action, suit,
    or proceeding, that person shall be indemnified against expenses (including
    actual and reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by that person in connection
    with the action, suit or proceeding as well as in connection with the
    action, suit or proceeding brought to enforce the mandatory indemnification
    provided in this Subsection.

    2. An indemnification under
    [Section 1](#indemnification-third-party-actions) or
    [Section 2](#indemnification-actions-in-the-right-of-the-corporation) of
    this Article, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by this Corporation
    only as authorized in a specific case upon a determination that
    indemnification of the Director, officer, employee, volunteer or agent is
    proper in the circumstances because that person has met the applicable
    standard of conduct as set forth in either
    [Section 1](#indemnification-third-party-actions) or
    [Section 2](#indemnification-actions-in-the-right-of-the-corporation). That
    determination shall be made in any of the following ways:

        1. By majority vote of a quorum of the Board consisting of Directors who
        were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding.

        2. If that quorum is not obtainable, then by a majority vote of a
        Committee of Directors who were not parties to the action, suit, or
        proceeding. The Committee shall consist of not less than two (2)
        disinterested Directors.

        3. By independent legal counsel in a written opinion.

    3. If a person is entitled to indemnification under
    [Section 1](#indemnification-third-party-actions) or
    [Section 2](#indemnification-actions-in-the-right-of-the-corporation) of
    this Article for a portion of expenses including attorneys’ fees, judgments,
    penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement, but not for the total
    amount thereof, the Corporation may indemnify the person for the portion of

Advances_. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding described in [Section 1](#indemnification-third-party-actions)
or [Section 2](#indemnification-actions-in-the-right-of-the-corporation) of this
Article may be paid by this Corporation in advance of the final disposition of
the action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of the Director, officer, employee, volunteer or agent to repay the expense if
it is ultimately determined that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by
this Corporation. The undertaking shall be by unlimited general obligation of
the person on whose behalf advances are made but need not be secured.

5. _Indemnification: Continuation of Right_. The indemnification provided in
[Sections 1](#indemnification-third-party-actions) through
[4](#indemnification-expense-advances) of this Article shall continue as to a

and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of any
deceased or former Director, officer, employee or agent who would have been
entitled to indemnification.

rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or a contractual
agreement. However, the total amount of expenses advanced or indemnified from
all sources combined shall not exceed the amount of actual expenses incurred by
the person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses.

any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee, volunteer or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, business
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in any such
capacity or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify the person against such liability
under [Sections 1](#indemnification-third-party-actions) through
[6](#indemnification-hereunder-not-exclusive) of this Article.

8. _Mergers_. For purposes of this Article, references to the “corporation”
include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger, as
well as the resulting or surviving corporation, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of the constituent corporation, or is
serving as a director, officer, employee, volunteer or agent of another foreign
or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
whether for profit or not, shall stand in the same position under the provisions

business corporation as the person would if he or she had served the resulting
